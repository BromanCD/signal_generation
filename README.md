# signal_generation
So I have created this small project just as a fun exercise to learn more about the project

### What does it do?
1) So, first of all we generate a simple sine wave that carries the information.
2) Then to pass on the information we generate another carrier wave of high frequency so that it can travel (this is a rf signal)
3) Now after this we do Amplitude Modulation of the carrier and the messanger wave by formula
->(Amplitude of AM + messanger_wave)*carrier wave (->Learnt this formula in a gfg article)

4. Then after we plot this AM wave
5. After that we generate the spectogram of this signal and plot it using matplotlib

### Resources used to learn this:
